### Issues on the road
October 4th I got pull & push issues when trying to update previous pushed commits accordin to followin instructions https://algerwrites.medium.com/how-to-remove-env-from-git-commit-history-1d594917b376 . On tutors recommendation I started a new workspace. Which resulted in confusion with code and commits being "broken". 73 pulled and 78 pushed but got stuck in the middle.
